# Stroke_Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a binary classification model using a logistic regression architecture implemented in PyTorch to predict whether a person is likely to experience a stroke. It uses a real-world healthcare dataset containing both demographic and medical information.

## Objectives
Load, clean, and explore the stroke dataset

Preprocess data: handle missing values, encode categorical features, normalize inputs

Train a logistic regression model using deep learning techniques (PyTorch)

Evaluate model performance using loss curves, accuracy metrics, and confusion matrix

Visualize categorical predictors against stroke outcomes

## Model Evaluation:
Test accuracy - 95.2%
